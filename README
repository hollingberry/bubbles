dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles. You probably don't want to use them.

INSTALLATION
------------

Clone the repo into some folder and run:

  rake symlinks:update

This will symlink any dotfile in the repo to $HOME and move other files where
they should go. You can configure the symlinking process in the Rakefile.

If you want to wipe all of the symlinks, run:

  rake symlinks:clean

This will remove all the symlinks on your system that were created by the
previous command.

dotfiles
========

A collection of miscellaneous configuration files for things like vim and zsh.
Includes a small Rakefile to create symlinks to the dotfiles in the home
directory. Inspired by @holman's collection of dotfiles.

These are my dotfiles. You probably don't want to use them.

INSTALLATION
------------

Clone the repo into some folder and run:

  rake symlinks:update

This will symlink any dotfile in the repo to $HOME and move other files where
they should go. You can configure which files are symlinked into which
directories in the symlinks.yml file.

If you want to wipe all of the symlinks, run:

  rake symlinks:clean

This will remove all the symlinks on your system that were created by the
previous command.
